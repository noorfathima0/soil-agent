      <h4>The main types of soil are:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sandy soil</strong></li>
        <p>This soil is made up of small particles of weathered rocks. It is light, dry, and warm, but low in nutrients and often acidic. Sandy soil dries out quickly and water and fertilizer tend to leach out of it.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Clay soil</strong></li>
        <p>This soil is heavy, wet, and cold in winter, and baked dry in summer. It is high in nutrients and has a large surface area, which allows it to hold nutrients and release them into soil water for plants to use. Clay soil is distinguished from sand and silt by its ability to swell and retain its shape.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Silt soil</strong></li>
        <p>This soil is made up of medium-sized particles that are smaller than sand but larger than clay. It is fertile, light, and moisture-retentive. Silt is very common in swampy and muddy conditions.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Loamy soil</strong></li>
        <p>This soil is a mixture of sand, silt, and clay in relatively equal proportions. It is considered to be one of the most productive soil types for agriculture and gardening. Loamy soil retains moisture well while also providing good drainage and aeration for plant roots.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Chalky soil</strong></li>
        <p>This soil is made up mostly of calcium carbonate from sediment that has built up over time. It is usually shallow, stony, and dries out quickly.</p>
      </ul>
